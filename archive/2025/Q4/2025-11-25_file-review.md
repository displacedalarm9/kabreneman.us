## Repository Status Assessment

### Core Components (Active)
| Component | Status | Last Updated |
|-----------|--------|--------------|
| Templates | ✓ Active | 2025-06-06 |
| Procedures | ✓ Active | 2025-06-06 |
| Documentation | ✓ Active | 2025-06-06 |
| Scripts | ✓ Active | Current |

### Archive Structure
| Path | Content | Status |
|------|---------|--------|
| `archive/2025/Q2/` | Q2 folder audit | ✓ Organized |
| `archive/2025/Q4/` | Q4 miscellaneous files | ✓ New |
| `archive/abandoned-projects/` | Legacy project documentation | ✓ Organized |

## Observations

1. **Repository Organization**: Well-structured with clear separation of templates, procedures, and documentation
2. **Naming Conventions**: Following established `YYYY-MM-DD_type.md` pattern
3. **File Status System**: Using YAML frontmatter with valid status types (template, report, protocol, active, log)
4. **Cross-References**: Extensive use of `[See: path]` references between documents

## Recommendations

1. Continue organizing off-repository files upon upload
2. Maintain Q4 archive folder for any additional 2025 Q4 items
3. Consider periodic review of root-level files to ensure proper organization
