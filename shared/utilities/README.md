# Shared Utilities

This directory contains reusable utility modules and libraries that can be imported by projects.

## Guidelines

- Place Python modules and reusable code here
- Utilities should be self-contained with minimal external dependencies
- Document usage examples for each utility

## Current Contents

| Module | Description | Usage |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| (empty) | Add shared utility modules here | - |

## Usage Example

```python
# From a project directory
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, '../../shared/utilities')
from my_utility import helper_function
```

[See: ../README.md for shared resources overview]
