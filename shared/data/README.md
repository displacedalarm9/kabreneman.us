# Shared Data

This directory contains data files that are shared across multiple projects.

## Guidelines

- Place reference data that multiple projects need access to here
- Data files should be documented with their source and update frequency
- Sensitive data should be excluded via `.gitignore` (see repository root `.gitignore`)

## Current Contents

| File | Description | Update Frequency |
|------|-------------|------------------|
| (empty) | Add shared data files here | - |

[See: ../README.md for shared resources overview]
